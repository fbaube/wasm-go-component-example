# wasm-component-example

A minimal working version of the ByteCode Alliance's 
[adder example](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/language-support/building-a-simple-component/go.html). 

Be sure you have the correct <i>(<b>old</b>)</i> version of <tt>wasm-tools</tt> installed. Plus the necessary rust stuff. 

Among the sequentially numbered shell files, steps 4 and 7 are optional.

After step 7 (or 6), <tt>cd example-host</tt> and then <tt>sh RUN-IT.sh</tt> .
